WorkTimeTracker
WorkTimeTracker is a command-line interface (CLI) based Python application designed to help users manage and calculate the total number of hours worked for multiple employers during a given month. The application allows users to add employers, input worked hours, specify hourly rates, calculate pre and post-tax earnings, generate monthly reports, and edit hours and rates. It also integrates with a database for structured data storage.
